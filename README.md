# Computational Physics â€“ Academic Coursework Portfolio

This repository showcases selected assignments and group projects completed during my Masterâ€™s degree in Computational Physics. It includes applied work across five modules, demonstrating my experience with numerical simulation, inverse modeling, scientific computing, parallel programming, and stochastic processes. Each folder contains a dedicated README file outlining the project focus, methodology, and instructions to run the majority of the code.

## Modules and Highlights

### ðŸ”¹ Scientific Computing
Two projects focused on solving structured linear systems, QR decomposition, and modeling reaction-diffusion systems. Topics include matrix conditioning, polynomial and rational approximation, and pattern formation using finite difference schemes and forward Euler.

### ðŸ”¹ Inverse Problems
Three assignments covering linear inverse problems, Bayesian inversion using Metropolis sampling, and non-linear least squares optimization. Applications range from seismic tomography and magnetic inversion to spectral analysis using Gaussian and Lorentzian fitting.

### ðŸ”¹ High Performance Parallel Computing
Assignments span GPU programming with CUDA, OpenACC acceleration, and SIMD/OpenMP optimization. Projects include a CUDA Ising model, shallow water equations, and molecular dynamics, combining profiling, scaling analysis, and algorithmic tuning.

### ðŸ”¹ Diffusive and Stochastic Processes
Simulations of stochastic systems using Euler and Gillespie methods. These include a Langevin dynamics system and SIR-like epidemic models with extensions for immunity and statistical ensemble analysis.

### ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning
A solo project covering classification, regression, and clustering. Implementations include XGBoost, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, with model explainability via SHAP/permutation importance and hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian search. Both supervised and unsupervised methods are demonstrated. A group project regarding segmentation and binary classification of gut cells/nuclei after the administration of a drug. The end-to-end pipeline includes preprocessing (Histogram Equalization, Outlier detection) as well as a CNN, XGBoost, Random Forest and a pretrained network (ResNet18).
