# Computational Physics â€“ Academic Coursework Portfolio

This repository showcases selected assignments and group projects completed during my Masterâ€™s degree in Computational Physics. It includes applied work across five modules, demonstrating my experience with numerical simulation, inverse modeling, scientific computing, parallel programming, and stochastic processes. Each folder contains a dedicated README file outlining the project focus, methodology, and instructions to run the majority of the code.

## Modules and Highlights

### ðŸ”¹ Scientific Computing
Two projects focused on solving structured linear systems, QR decomposition, and modeling reaction-diffusion systems. Topics include matrix conditioning, polynomial and rational approximation, and pattern formation using finite difference schemes and forward Euler.

### ðŸ”¹ Inverse Problems
Three assignments covering linear inverse problems, Bayesian inversion using Metropolis sampling, and non-linear least squares optimization. Applications range from seismic tomography and magnetic inversion to spectral analysis using Gaussian and Lorentzian fitting.

### ðŸ”¹ High Performance Parallel Computing
Assignments span GPU programming with CUDA, OpenACC acceleration, and SIMD/OpenMP optimization. Projects include a CUDA Ising model, shallow water equations, and molecular dynamics, combining profiling, scaling analysis, and algorithmic tuning.

### ðŸ”¹ Diffusive and Stochastic Processes
Simulations of stochastic systems using Euler and Gillespie methods. These include a Langevin dynamics system and SIR-like epidemic models with extensions for immunity and statistical ensemble analysis.

### ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning *(Coming soon)*
A separate README will be added summarizing the group project from the Machine Learning course.

## Notes

- Each assignment clearly states whether it was an individual or group project.
- Some solutions re-implement core algorithms (e.g., LU decomposition, Gillespie method) to demonstrate low-level numerical understanding.
